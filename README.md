### Distance Calculator

## Description

Calculate distance from point A to point B using latitude and longitude.

# Note: The distance between Point A and Point B is calculated using the Haversine formula,
which is used to calculate the shortest distance between two points on a perfect sphere.
Given that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, the distance calculated here is approximate.
